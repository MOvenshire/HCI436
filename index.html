        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Time Tumbler is a day planner and calendar that places a focus on making the lives of those with ADHD easier.</p>
        <p> It does this through tools like clear organization and features such as a day organizing algorithm that both clears conflicts and fits in breaks wherever possible.</p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>

        <p>An adult with ADHD may struggle to manage a calendar with too many overlapping events. Current calendar applications, such as Google Calendar or Notion, lack the ability to schedule events for the user. Our web application streamlines this process and acts as a personal secretary that will optimize a given schedule. This will also update study sessions to include breaks and a more consistent workflow. This creates a healthier interaction between a user that might struggle to focus for long periods of time and a more fulfilling schedule.</p>

        <p> The "add event" screen, with options for the priority and flexibility of the event, as well as the ability to add a fun, personal event type in the form of an emoji. There also exists the option to upload a calendar file from another app.</p>

        <p>After hitting the optimize button, the calendar removes any non mandatory events marked by the user and adds breaks in between them.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion and future work</h2>
        <p>For future iterations, we will consider further customization. Currently, the prototypes are limited by the values manually added to the calendar. We would like to implement the ability to upload an ics file to pre-populate or update the calendar.  We will also increase customization by increasing the settings page to allow users to select their calendar colors. Users might also prefer a system that allows them to set working hours so that the scheduler does not move things outside of working hours. Additionally, we will allow users to edit the duration of study breaks, and if they so wish, they will be also able to toggle this feature for uninterrupted study sessions.</p>
